Lose points: not fclose the file and not compare calculated pi with actuall pi to stop iteration.

HW3  
Matrix calculator using array and vector.  
Lose points: pass vectors by value...   
I didn't find clear instruction tells me to always call by value or reference. Since this homework ask me to show understanding of calling by value and reference. I try to communicate with TA, if fail, anyone try this home should better use call by reference for vector case to avoid this points loss.
